# Before we start

We will need to install the programming language `R` and the IDE
(Integrated Development Environment) `RStudio`:

1.  [Download and Install R](https://cloud.r-project.org/)
2.  [Download and Install RStudio
    Desktop](https://posit.co/download/rstudio-desktop/) (Click on the
    button under `2: Install RStudio`)

# Creating a new Quarto Website project

After install R and RStudio Desktop, open RStudio.

1.  On the menu on the top, click on `File` then select `New Project`
    ![](images/step-1-new-project.png)
2.  A window will pop up, click on the `New Directory` option
    ![](images/step-2-new-directory.png)
3.  For project type, select `Quarto Website`
    ![](images/step-3-project-type.png)
4.  For my directory (folder) name I chose `bio-diversity-project` and I
    will have my project live in my `Documents` folder
    ![](images/step-4-choose-folder.png)
5.  RStudio creates a default website for you, you can see what it looks
    like by clicking on the `Render` button at the top of the top-left
    panel ![](images/step-5-render.png)
6.  Your browser window should pop up the website
7.  Now you are all set up to make some changes to it to make your own.

# Customizing your website

The file that should be open for editing is `index.qmd` -- that is the
first page users see when they go to your website. We call it the
landing page.

You can switch between `Source` and `Visual` editing by click on the
option you prefer at the top of the document ![](images/Source-Visual.png)

I personally prefer the `Source` mode.

Change the text and the title. Here's what I have for my `index.qmd`:

```         
---
title: "Adriana's Website"
---

I'm an Assistant Professor of Practice in Computer Science, where I teach students
to develop a passion for all things coding. Being a Data Scientist (in addition to
being a computer scientist), I am also involved in a number of efforts in data
science education.
```

Click the render button to see your changes.

The text we are typing in our `index.qmd` is markdown, which is a way to
format text documents. Here's some markdown syntax you should try:

-   use `*` around a word to make that word *italics*
-   use `**` around a word (or any stretch of text) to make it **bold**

Here's my updated file:

```

I'm an *Assistant Professor of Practice* in Computer Science, where I teach students
to develop a passion for all things coding. Being a *Data Scientist* (in addition to
being a computer scientist), I am also involved in a number of efforts in data
science education.
```

Check out this [Markdown Basics page](https://quarto.org/docs/authoring/markdown-basics.html)
for more formatting options.

## Adding links

To add a link, you use `[]` around the text that will be clickable,
followed by the web address inside `()`. I'm linking the words
`Computer Science` in my text to my department website:

```         
---

I'm an *Assistant Professor of Practice* in [Computer Science](https://cs.arizona.edu/), 
where I teach students to develop a passion for all things coding. Being a *Data Scientist* 
(in addition to being a computer scientist), I am also involved in a number of 
efforts in data science education.
```

Click the render button to see your changes.

## Changing the `About` page

Let's work on the `about.qmd` page. On the right-bottom panel there's a
list of files in your website project. Click on `about.qmd` to open this
file to edit ![](images/open-existing-file.png)

Here's some text for your about page: *The Bio/Diversity Project is a collaborative effort between WISE, Saguaro National Park and the Friends of Saguaro National Park, with additional support from local environmental organizations, aimed at increasing the diversity of voices included in discussions of environmental problems and the development of their solutions. By increasing access to innovative environmental science educational opportunities and training, mentoring, and work experience along the K-16+ educational pipeline, we aim to get students excited about environmental science and support them along their educational journeys and into the workforce*

Add a links to these websites:

* https://biodiversityproject.arizona.edu/
* https://wise.arizona.edu/
* https://www.nps.gov/sagu/index.htm
* https://www.friendsofsaguaro.org/

## Adding images to `About` page

Let's add a saguaro image to our about page.

A good website for fair-use images is [unsplash](https://unsplash.com/).
Find a free image you like and download it.

We will create an images folder in our project to keep things organize.

1. Find your project folder in your computer
1. Create a new folder called `images` ![](images/images-folder.png)
1. Copy the image you downloaded over to your `images` folder


Now that you have an image you like to use, let's add it to our `About` page.
Here's the syntax to add an image in quarto markdown (I changed the name of my
image file to `saguaro`:

```
![Photo by Karl Magnuson](images/saguaro.png)
```

You write a caption between the `[]` and then between the `()` you have the path
to your image file. Since my `saguaro.png` file is inside my `images` folder in
my project, my image path is `images/saguaro.png`.

# Adding images to `index.qmd` 

Let's go back to the `index.qmd` and add a profile picture to our page.
First make sure you have an image file you want to use inside your `images` folder.

Here's my updated page with my image (I left the caption empty for this one for now):

```

title: "Adriana's Website"

![](images/profile-photo.jpg)

I'm an *Assistant Professor of Practice* in [Computer Science](https://cs.arizona.edu/), 
where I teach students to develop a passion for all things coding. Being a *Data Scientist* 
(in addition to being a computer scientist), I am also involved in a number of 
efforts in data science education.
```

I clicked render and the image is too big, so let's make it smaller.
Here's some options of syntax to set the width of an image:

* width in pixels: `![](images/profile-photo.jpg){width=300}`
* width in inches: `![](images/profile-photo.jpg){width=4in}`
* width in percent of the total space: `![](images/profile-photo.jpg){width=80%}`

If you want more information on options for formatting images you can check out
the [Quarto help page on Figures](https://quarto.org/docs/authoring/figures.html).

The page would look better if the text were side-by-side with my profile image.
We can create columns to address this issue.

# Adding columns to our page

Here's the syntax we are going to use to create columns:

```
:::: {.columns}

Text and other columns go here

::::
```

We first create a block of columns as shown above.

Then each individual column will have the following syntax:

```
::: {.column}

Specific column text and images go here

:::
```

Here's what my `index.qmd` document looks like:

```

title: "Adriana's Website"

:::: {.columns}

::: {.column}

![](images/profile-photo.jpg){width=300}

:::

::: {.column}

I'm an Assistant Professor of Practice in Computer Science, where I teach students
to develop a passion for all things coding. Being a Data Scientist (in addition to
being a computer scientist), I am also involved in a number of efforts in data
science education as well.

:::

::::

```

Individual columns can also have width (and other properties) set:

```
::: {.column width="30%"}

Specific column text and images go here

:::
```
